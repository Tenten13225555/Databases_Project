# Hospital Resource Management: A SQL Project

## Overview

The healthcare industry faces increasing challenges related to data management and resource allocation. This project aims to build a database model that efficiently manages hospital resources, from patients and care centers to treatments, nurses, and physicians. 

## Problem Statement

With an ever-increasing number of patients, treatments, and staff, it's crucial for healthcare providers to have quick and accurate access to information. Whether it's knowing which nurse is in charge of a specific care center or tracking patient treatments, data management is a significant challenge.

## Project Objective

The main objective is to create a robust and scalable SQL-based database that:

1. Streamlines the management of patients, care centers, and staff
2. Enables quick and efficient retrieval of information
3. Ensures data integrity and reliability

## Features

- **Patients Table**: Stores patient ID, name, address, phone number, and associated care center.
- **Care Centers Table**: Information about different care centers and their in-charge nurses.
- **Treatments Table**: Contains ongoing treatments with details like treatment type and associated physician.
- **Nurses Table**: Information on nurses, their types of certificates, and salaries.
- **Physicians Table**: Stores details of physicians, their specializations, and salaries.

## Technical Implementation

This project is implemented using SQL with the following major steps:

1. **Table Creation**: SQL scripts to create tables for each entity.
2. **Indexing**: Creating necessary indexes to speed up data retrieval.
3. **Data Insertion**: Inserting sample data to simulate the hospital environment.
4. **Querying**: SQL queries for data retrieval and management.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Make sure you have MySQL or a compatible database installed.
3. Run the SQL scripts in your database.
